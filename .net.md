## History

### [.NET Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework)
In April 2019, Microsoft released .NET Framework 4.8, the last version of the framework as a proprietary offering. 
Only monthly security and reliability bug fixes to that version have been released since then. 
No further changes to that version are planned.

### [.NET Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_.NET_libraries_and_frameworks#.NET_Standard)
The .NET Standard is a set of common APIs that are implemented in the Base Class Library of any .NET implementation. 
The class library of each implementation must implement the .NET Standard, but may also implement additional APIs. 

### [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)
In November 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5.0. 
The "Core" branding was removed and version 4.0 was skipped to avoid conflation with .NET Framework, which remains the Windows-specific product. 
It addresses the patent concerns related to the .NET Framework.
