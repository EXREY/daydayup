[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262.   
It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations.  
JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript.  
ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.

## Compiler
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a JavaScript compiler.
  - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 



## Engine
- [V8](https://v8.dev/) is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/), and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
- [QuickJS Javascript Engine](https://bellard.org/quickjs/)
  - QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the ES2020 specification including modules, asynchronous generators and proxies.
  - It optionally supports mathematical extensions such as big integers (BigInt), big floating point numbers (BigFloat) and operator overloading.
- [mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine](https://github.com/cesanta/mjs), Embedded JavaScript engine for C/C++
  - mJS is designed for microcontrollers with limited resources. Main design goals are: small footprint and simple C/C++ interoperability. mJS implements a strict subset of ES6 (JavaScript version 6):
    - Any valid mJS code is a valid ES6 code.
    - Any valid ES6 code is not necessarily a valid mJS code.
  - On 32-bit ARM mJS engine takes about 50k of flash memory, and less than 1k of RAM (see intro article). mJS is part of MongooseOS, where it enables scripting for IoT devices.
- [jerryscript](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript) is a lightweight JavaScript engine for resource-constrained devices such as microcontrollers. It can run on devices with less than 64 KB of RAM and less than 200 KB of flash memory.



## Tools
- [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.
