A [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.

## Tools
 - [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) 
  ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
 - [SourceGraph](https://sourcegraph.com/)
  Find and fix things across all of your code faster with Sourcegraph. Onboard to a new codebase, make large-scale refactors, increase efficiency, address security risks, root-cause incidents, and more.
