## About
- [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is an operating system used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large [community](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html) has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking, security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the [busiest web sites](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/nutshell.html#introduction-nutshell-users) and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.
- [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography. As an example of the effect OpenBSD has, the popular [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) software comes from OpenBSD.
- [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/) is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It is available for a wide range of platforms, from large-scale servers and powerful desktop systems to handheld and embedded devices.
- [DragonFlyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/) belongs to the same class of operating systems as other BSD-derived systems and Linux. It is based on the same UNIX ideals and APIs and shares ancestor code with other BSD operating systems. DragonFly provides an opportunity for the BSD base to grow in an entirely different direction from the one taken in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD series.
