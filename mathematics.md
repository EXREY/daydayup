[Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, "knowledge, study, learning") includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change (mathematical analysis). It has no generally accepted definition.  
Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

## Learn
- [Math Is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/) 
  - We offer mathematics in an enjoyable and easy-to-learn manner, because we believe that mathematics is fun.
  - The site aims to cover the full Kindergarten to Year 12 curriculum.
- [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), by Grant Sanderson, is some combination of math and entertainment, depending on your disposition. The goal is for explanations to be driven by animations and for difficult problems to be made simple with changes in perspective.
- [Interactive Mathematics](https://www.intmath.com/) Learn math while you play with it
- At [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/), we are training the intellectual leaders of the next generation. We help students develop the problem-solving skills they need to confidently tackle challenging problems—and not only in mathematics.

## [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
### Books
- [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/index.html) is a guide to the most popular statistical errors and slip-ups committed by scientists every day, in the lab and in peer-reviewed journals. Many of the errors are prevalent in vast swaths of the published literature, casting doubt on the findings of thousands of papers. Statistics Done Wrong assumes no prior knowledge of statistics, so you can read it before your first statistics course or after thirty years of scientific practice.

## [Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)
- [Elementary Number Theory](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/numbertheory/book.pdf)
- [PARI/GP](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves, modular forms, L functions...), but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow for faster computations.
