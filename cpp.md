## Learn
- [The C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result of many person-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but they can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs.
