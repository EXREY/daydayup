[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiles a strict variant of [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (basically JavaScript with types) to [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). It generates lean and mean WebAssembly modules while being just an npm install away.

[Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly, written in C++. It aims to make compiling to WebAssembly easy, fast, and effective:
