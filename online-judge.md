An online judge is an online system to test programs in programming contests. They are also used to practice for such contests.

The system can compile and execute your code, and test your code with pre-constructed data. Submitted code may be run with restrictions, including time limit, memory limit, security restriction and so on. The output of the code will be captured by the system, and compared with the standard output. The system will then return the result.

When mistakes were found in a standard output, the submission will be unsuccessful. You must correct any errors in the code, and resubmit for re-judgement.

### [PARI/GP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARI/GP) 
- [PARI/GP](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves, modular forms, L functions...), but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow for faster computations.  
Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Université Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.
- `PARI` is a C library, allowing fast computations.
- `gp` is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the PARI functions.
- `GP` is the name of gp's scripting language.
- `gp2c`, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds by compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading the resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically run 3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset of the GP language.
