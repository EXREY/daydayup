    - Find something written by a native English speaker (an article on the Internet, a chapter from a book, a resume, etc.)
      1. Read one sentence, make sure you understand everything, then take a moment to memorize it.
      2. Switch to a text editor, and write down the sentence from memory. If you can't remember some of the words in the sentence, you make a guess or use other words with similar meanings.
      3. Compare what you wrote with the original to see if you made any mistakes. If you did, correct them, go `step 2` do it again. If you didn't, choose the following sentence, go `step 1`.
    - Read a lot in English regularly.
