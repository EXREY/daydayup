# Learn
- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs), Whirlwind tours of (several, hopefully many someday) popular and ought-to-be-more-popular programming languages, presented as valid, commented code and explained as they go.
- [Project Based Learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning), A list of programming tutorials in which learners build an application from scratch. These tutorials are divided into different primary programming languages. Some have intermixed technologies and languages.
