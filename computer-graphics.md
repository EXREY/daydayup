- [Computer Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)) is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.  
  Computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the mathematical and computational foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely aesthetic issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of visualization, although the two fields have many similarities.

- [WebGLStudio.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/webglstudio.js) is an open-source, browser-based 3D graphics suite. You can edit scenes and materials, design effects and shaders, code behaviours, and share your work - all within a browser using standard web technologies.


# [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
