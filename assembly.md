## [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly) (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
- [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiles a strict subset of [[TypeScript]] (basically JavaScript with types) to WebAssembly using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). It generates lean and mean WebAssembly modules while being just an `npm install` away.
- [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application.
