- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.  
Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.  
Pygame itself has been downloaded millions of times.  
Pygame is free. Released under the LGPL licence, you can create open source, freeware, shareware, and commercial games with it. See the licence for full details.
