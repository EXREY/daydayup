- :star:[Spellbook of Modern Web Dev](https://github.com/dexteryy/spellbook-of-modern-webdev) A Big Picture, Thesaurus, and Taxonomy of Modern JavaScript Web Development - [现代 Web 开发的现状与未来（JSDC 2019 演讲全文）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/88616149)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) is optimized for learning, testing, and training. Examples might be simplified to improve reading and basic understanding. Tutorials, references, and examples are constantly reviewed to avoid errors, but we cannot warrant full correctness of all content.
  - [W3FOOLS](https://www.w3fools.com) 
    - When W3Fools was launched in 2011, the state of documentation for developers was poor. This site [documented many content errors and issues](https://web.archive.org/web/20110412103745/http://w3fools.com) with the W3Schools website. The [Mozilla Developer Network](http://developer.mozilla.org/) was around but it did not have much support at the time. 
    - Today, W3Schools has largely resolved these issues and addressed the majority of the undersigned developers' concerns. For many beginners, W3Schools has structured tutorials and playgrounds that offer a decent learning experience. Do keep in mind: a more complete education will certainly include MDN and other reputable resources.
