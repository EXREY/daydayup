#### [PARI/GP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARI/GP) 
- [PARI/GP](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves, modular forms, L functions...), but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow for faster computations.  
Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√© Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.
- `PARI` is a C library, allowing fast computations.
- `gp` is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the PARI functions.
- `GP` is the name of gp's scripting language.
- `gp2c`, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds by compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading the resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically run 3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset of the GP language.
