# Learn
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [learn](https://github.com/gyuho/learn), The best way to learn is to teach what you have learned to other people. I tried YouTube channel, which was hard to maintain. So I decided to write my own textbook. I am still learning, and I may say things out of ignorance. Every post is working in progress, non-committal on a timeline. The point is to review and improve over time. This is a personal white-board where I scribble anything, organize my code, learning experiences.
